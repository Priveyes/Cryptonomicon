# Cryptonomicon
Tool to help debug cryptographic issues encountered with EMV chip cards.

This project requires the Flint source, which it currently expects in a Flint directory in the project directory.  
The required files can be found at https://github.com/fluzwup/cryptography-in-c-cpp/tree/master/flint/src

This project is named after Neal Stephenson's "Cryptonomicon", which I thought appropriate as both the book and the software deal with finance and encryption.
